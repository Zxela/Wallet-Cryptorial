# Baaaaes ðŸ’“

**Baaaes** is a **very opinionated** boilerplate for APIs using `async`/`await`, [Express](http://expressjs.com) and [Sequelize](http://sequelizejs.com).

The basic code was created with [`express-generator`](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html), then the following changes were added:

* Complete conversion to native ES6 syntax (i.e. you **won't** need Babel, thankfully!)
* HTTPS support included, and you can generate self-signed certificates for development by running `npm run makecert`. Note that you **will** see warning messages; use [Let's encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and a real domain name to avoid this.
* [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) support baked in with configuration examples.
* Differentiated environments (`development`, `test` and `production`) defined by the `APP_ENV` environment variable.
* [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) templates for HTML views.
* [Sequelize](http://sequelizejs.com) as default ORM, along with an example model implementation making extensive use of the `async`/`await` pattern to minimize frustration.
* Example API routes _with fully working RESTful CRUD endpoints_ included!
* [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) integration tests for the example API are _also included!_

**Baaaes** gives you a fully fleshed-out boilerplate with woking examples and tests - you just have to jump in and modify it to your needs. I've tried to make the code as legible as possible with plenty of comments where necessary.

## Making Express great again with `async`/`await`

Let's face it, working with databases in Node was always annoying (to say the least) before the introduction of `async`/`await` in Node 7. The good news is **if your code uses promises, you can use `async`/`await` right now**.

So instead of writing an API endpoint like this...
```js
// GET /products
// Returns a JSON array containing all available product objects
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
    models.Product.findAll()
    .then((result) => {
      res.json(result)
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      res.status(400).json(error)
    })
  }
})
```
...you can write this instead!
```js
router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    res.json(await models.Product.findAll())
  }
  catch(error) {
    res.status(400).json(error)
  }
})
```

Note how you can use `try`/`catch` for async error handling - and YES, IT WORKS! ðŸ’“
